## Saffman-Taylor instability/ Viscous fingering

Viscous fingering is a phenomenon that occurs when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous fluid in a porous medium, resulting in the formation of finger-like patterns. This phenomenon is commonly observed in various natural and industrial processes, such as oil recovery, groundwater flow, and chemical reactions. When a less viscous fluid, known as the displacing fluid, is injected into a more viscous fluid, known as the displaced fluid, the interface between the two fluids becomes unstable. This instability leads to the formation of fingers or channels of the displacing fluid penetrating into the displaced fluid. The fingers grow and branch out, creating intricate patterns that resemble the shape of fingers. The occurrence of viscous fingering can be attributed to the difference in fluid viscosities and the capillary forces within the porous medium. The capillary forces tend to draw the displacing fluid into the pores of the medium, causing it to advance faster in certain regions and creating finger-like patterns.

Viscous fingering has significant implications in various applications. In oil recovery, for example, it can reduce the efficiency of the displacement process, resulting in lower oil recovery rates. Understanding and controlling viscous fingering is crucial for optimizing oil recovery techniques, such as water flooding or enhanced oil recovery methods. In fluid mechanics, mathematical models and simulations are often used to study and predict the behavior of viscous fingering. These models take into account factors such as fluid properties, porous medium characteristics, and injection rates to simulate the growth and evolution of the finger patterns. We solve for the concentration field($C$) that is governed by the following equation

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial C}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} = \nabla^2 C,$$

with the constraint on the velocity field: 

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0$$

Our algorithm is developed based on vorticity-stream function formulation. The steps are given below

1. Given: $C_n$, $\psi_n$
2. Compute $J_n$ from the equation below
	
	$$J_n = \frac{\partial \psi_n}{\partial y} \frac{\partial C_n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial \psi_n}{\partial x} \frac{\partial C_n}{\partial y}$$

3. Compute $\overline{C}$
	
$$\frac{\overline{C}-C_n}{dt} = 0.5 J_n \qquad\qquad \text{for the first time step only}$$
		
$$\frac{\overline{C}-C_n}{dt} = 1.5 J_n - J_{n-1}\qquad\qquad \text{otherwise}$$
	
4. Compute $\psi_{n+1}$

$$\nabla^2 \psi_{n+1} = -\overline{\omega} = R\left( \frac{\partial \psi_n}{\partial x} \frac{\partial \overline{C}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \psi_n}{\partial y} \frac{\partial \overline{C}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \overline{C}}{\partial y}\right)$$
	
	
5. Compute $\overline{J}$
	
$$\overline{J} = \frac{\partial \psi_{n+1}}{\partial y} \frac{\partial \overline{C}}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial \psi_{n+1}}{\partial x} \frac{\partial \overline{C}}{\partial y}$$
	
6. Compute $C_{n+1}$

$$\frac{\overline{C}-C_n}{dt} = -\frac{1}{2} (J_n + \overline{J}) + \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 (C_n + \overline{C})$$
	
	
	
7. Update old values with the new ones

$$J_{n-1} = J_n$$
$$C_n = C_{n+1}$$
$$\psi_n = \psi_{n+1}$$
	
9. Go to step 2 if the final time is not reached.

## Dendritic growth

Dendritic growth is a phenomenon observed in fluid mechanics, specifically in the context of solidification processes. It refers to the formation of dendritic structures during the solidification of a liquid or molten material. When a liquid material undergoes solidification, it typically transitions from a disordered, liquid state to a more ordered, solid state. Dendritic growth occurs when the solidification process is characterized by the formation of tree-like or branch-like structures, known as dendrites. Dendrites are formed due to the anisotropic nature of the solidification process. As the liquid material cools and solidifies, it undergoes a phase transition, resulting in the formation of solid crystals. However, the growth of these crystals is not uniform in all directions. Instead, the crystals tend to grow preferentially along certain crystallographic directions, leading to the formation of dendritic structures. The growth of dendrites is influenced by various factors, including the temperature gradient, the concentration gradient, and the presence of impurities in the liquid material. These factors can affect the growth rate, morphology, and branching pattern of the dendrites.

Dendritic growth has significant implications in various fields, including materials science, metallurgy, and solidification processes. The morphology and microstructure of dendrites can impact the mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, and other characteristics of the solidified material. Therefore, understanding and controlling dendritic growth is crucial for optimizing the properties and performance of solidified materials. In fluid mechanics, the study of dendritic growth involves the analysis of the fluid flow and heat transfer during the solidification process. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and mathematical models are often used to predict and analyze the dendritic growth patterns in different materials and processing conditions.

Here, we solve for two dependent variables namely the phase field parameter($\phi$) and the temperature($T$). The phase field parameter assumes the value 1 within the solid phase and 0 within the liquid phase. The governing equation for the phase field parameter is:

$$\tau \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(\epsilon \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \theta} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \right) - \frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\epsilon \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \theta} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \right) + \epsilon\nabla^2 \phi + \phi (1-\phi) \left(\phi + m - \frac{1}{2} \right)$$

The governing equation for the temperature becomes

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 T + \kappa \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$$

In the above equation, $\kappa$ is the dimensionless latent heat. The value of the outer normal vector at the solid-liquid interface is evaluated as 

$$\epsilon = \bar{\epsilon} \sigma,$$

where
$$\sigma = 1 + \delta \cos (\beta (\theta - \theta_0)),$$
and
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\partial \phi/\partial y}{\partial \phi/\partial x}\right).$$

The parameter $m$ is computed as below
$$m = \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \tan ^{-1} \left[ \gamma (T_{eq} - T)\right].$$

In our simulation, we assumed the following values for the constants: $\alpha = 0.9$, $\gamma=10.0$, $T_{eq}=1.0$, $\beta=6.0$, $\theta_0=0.2$, $\delta=0.02$, $\kappa=1.8$, and $\bar{\epsilon}=0.01$. We used the simplest explicit time integration scheme to solve these governing PDEs.

## Spinoidal decomposition

Spinodal decomposition is a phenomenon that occurs in fluid mechanics, specifically in the study of phase separation in binary mixtures. It is a process where a homogeneous mixture spontaneously separates into two distinct phases due to the presence of thermodynamic instabilities. In a binary mixture, spinodal decomposition occurs when the system is in a metastable state, meaning it is not in equilibrium but is still stable for a certain period. This metastable state is characterized by a region in the phase diagram known as the spinodal region. The spinodal region is the region between the binodal curve and the spinodal curve. The binodal curve represents the boundary between the two-phase coexistence region and the single-phase region, while the spinodal curve represents the boundary between the metastable and unstable regions. When the system is in the spinodal region, small fluctuations in composition or density can grow exponentially, leading to the formation of distinct phases. These fluctuations are amplified by the negative second derivative of the free energy with respect to composition, which is a characteristic feature of the spinodal region.

In terms of applications, spinodal decomposition has significant implications in various fields, including materials science, polymer science, and colloid science. It plays a crucial role in the development of new materials with tailored properties, as well as in understanding the behavior of complex fluids.

We solve for the concentration field($C$) that is governed by the following equation
$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = M\nabla^2 \left(\mu - \kappa \nabla^2 C\right),$$
where $\mu = 2\alpha C(1-C) (1-2C)$. In our simulation, we considered the following values for the constants: $\alpha=1$, $M=1$, and $\kappa = 0.5$.
